Rebecca O’ Dwyer is an Irish art critic and writer based in Berlin. She holds a PhD from the department of Visual Culture at the National College of Art & Design in Dublin. She is currently working on a non-academic, book-length project.  

Her writing has appeared in _Paper Visual Art Journal_, _Source Photographic Review, Art Review, Real Life,_ _The White Review, Enclave Review_, _Fallow Media_, _Spike_, _frieze_, _032c_, _Eyeline_, _Apollo_, _The Stinging Fly,_ _The Tangerine_, and elsewhere; and she has written texts alongside exhibitions at the Project Arts Centre, The Irish Museum of Modern Art, The Douglas Hyde Gallery, Temple Bar Gallery, mother’s tankstation, and Artangel (online).

From 2016-2018, she edited the online art writing publication, _Response to a Request_, which included new writings by Isabel Nolan, Kevin Breathnach, Joanna Walsh, Mike McCormack, and many others. In keeping with the project's remit, these writings have since vanished, but you can read more about the project [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gah1wkntkGj9gaI_KwUoic1GXuvtM4BZ/view).
